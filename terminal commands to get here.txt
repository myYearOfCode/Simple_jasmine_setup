npm init
  in npm init it will walk you through a wizard to config your init file
  the only important thing is to put "karma start" in for the test command.
npm i jasmine-core karma karma-jasmine karma-jasmine-matchers puppeteer karma-chrome-launcher --save-dev
now karma start should start the test runner and a local server on port 9876

jasmine is the testing package
karma runs the tests and gives you feedback on results

puppeteer is used to run headless. Ie without an open browser. it is made by google

istanbul karma-cli karma-coverage are all used to report on code coverage
  as currently configured it creates a page at coverage/html/index.html
